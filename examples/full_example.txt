% Any line that starts with '%' is a comment and is ignored by the program.

% These set the x and y axises, and the interval between each tick.

xinterval    2.0
yrange      -5, 7
yinterval    2.0

% Draws a circle of radius 2.
circle 2

% Draws a point at (1, 2). Note that I'm using square brackets for all
% cartesian coordinates.
point [1, 2]

% You can plug in arbitrary math expressions. The order of operations
% is respected. The constant 'pi' and the sqrt function are provided
point [1 - (2 * 1.5), pi * sqrt(3)]

% You can also use complex numbers instead of cartesian coordinates.
% Note there is no implicit multiplication: you always have to do 
% 3 * i, not 3i.
% Therefore, [2, 2] is equivalent to 2 + 2 * i
point -pi + sqrt(3) * i

% You can add color to any line, point, circle, or text you add
% by adding an exclamation mark and the color name.
% See http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp for a list of
% all valid colors.
point 1 - i ! red

% You can draw lines between two points. Separate each complex number/coordinate
% with a comma.
line [0, 0], [2, 2]
line -i, 5 + i ! aqua

% You can draw circles. All circles are centered around the origin, and the number
% following is the radius.
circle 3.5 ! red
circle 2 ! green

% You can add text. The first argument is coordinate. The second argument is the 
% text to display. Note that it's surrounded by quote marks.
% To make text display on more than one line, use the '\n' symbol whenever you want
% a newline.
text [3,-3.5], "This is some text.\nBlah blah blah."

% You can define variables so you can refer to coordinates without constantly
% having to rewrite them. Here, I'm creating a variable called 'p1' which is
% equal to the cartesian coordinate [4, 4].
% Note the comma.
variable p1, [4, 4]

% To use a variable, place it where you would normally have a coordinate or complex
% number and prefix it with the '@' symbol.
% Don't forget about that '@' symbol!
point @p1 ! orange
line [5, 5], @p1 ! green
line [3, 5], @p1 ! green
line [5, 3], @p1 ! green
line [3, 3], @p1 ! green
